# Multi-Robot Firefighting Simulation

This repository contains a MATLAB-based simulation of a **multi-robot firefighting system** using potential field navigation. Robots detect fire hotspots, move toward them using the temperature gradient, maintain safe spacing, avoid hazardous regions, and suppress fires based on proximity. The project includes both a simple plotting mode and an advanced visualization using the **Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox**.

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `env_setup.m`
Central configuration file that defines:
- Workspace dimensions  
- Number of robots and their initial positions  
- Fire positions, intensities, and spreads  
- Control gains for attraction, repulsion, randomness, and safety  
- Simulation duration and timestep  

All other scripts depend on this setup.

---

### `temperature_field.m`
Computes:
- Temperature at a given (x, y) location  
- Gradient of the temperature field (∇T)  

Robots use this gradient to navigate toward fire hotspots.

---

### `robot_dynamics.m`
Defines the robot motion model:
- Attraction toward the temperature gradient  
- Repulsion from other robots  
- Avoidance of fire safety zones  
- Optional survey or exploration behavior  

Outputs velocity vectors for all robots.

---

### `propertyA.m`
Basic firefighting simulation:
- No external toolboxes required  
- Simulates robot movement and fire suppression  
- Produces trajectory and performance plots  

Use this for simple tests or comparisons.

---

### `propertyA_mrs.m`
Advanced animated simulation using the **Mobile Robotics Simulation Toolbox**:
- GUI-based multi-robot visualization  
- Fire zones, safety radii, suppression rings  
- Dynamic temperature and fire intensity display  
- Full real-time firefighting simulation  

This is the main file for running the complete simulation.

---

### `visualize_potential_field.m`
Generates analytical visualizations of:
- Fire attractive potential  
- Robot repulsive potential  
- Combined potential field  
- Gradient field arrows  

Useful for documentation, debugging, and academic reports.

---

### `save_potential_field_figures.m`
Saves the figures generated by `visualize_potential_field.m` into a `figures/` folder as `.png` and `.fig` formats.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

Follow these steps **in order**:

1. Run the file **env_setup.m**  
   This sets up the simulation world, robot parameters, fire parameters, and all control gains.

2. Run the file **temperature_field.m**  
   This loads the temperature model and the gradient function used by the robots.

3. Run the file **robot_dynamics.m**  
   This loads the robot motion model used throughout the simulation.

After these three steps, the entire environment and all models are fully initialized.

4. Run the file **propertyA_mrs.m**  
   This starts the full multi-robot firefighting simulation with animated visualization.

## 🔧 Customization

To modify simulation properties, edit:

- **env_setup.m** — Change number of robots, fire locations, intensities, gains, world size, etc.  
- **robot_dynamics.m** — Adjust movement logic, repulsion rules, and suppression behavior.  
- **propertyA_mrs.m** — Modify visualization and simulation flow.
